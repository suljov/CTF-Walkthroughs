### Hacking training for the best

Hack The Box gives individuals, businesses and universities the tools they need to
continuously improve their cybersecurity capabilities ‚Äî all in one place.





#### My thoughts

I like HackTheBox, the CTF boxes are good even tho some are not that good and very "CTF" like, but non the less its good. Tho you need to pay to play on the retired boxes and for those just want to just use the free option you only can play the active boxes (and some other stuff but i talk mainly about the CTF boxes here from my experience). But it still good they have a free option. Their academy is super good to learn, tho you need to pay but if you go from zero to pentester or is a knowledgeable person you still will learn good stuff. They have certifications which is very good (i am myself CPTS certified).
